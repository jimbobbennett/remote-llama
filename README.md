# RemoteLlama

RemoteLlama is a .NET tool for connecting to Ollama running on a remote server.

The eventual goal of this project is to provide a copy of Ollama with all the same CLI commands and API, but instead of running locally, it connects to Ollama running on a remote server.

## Why?

Why not!

Also this is great when you have tools that use Ollama, and you want to run them on a machine that is not powerful enough to run Ollama locally. You can run Ollama on a remote machine with a more powerful GPU for example, then use RemoteLlama to connect to it.
